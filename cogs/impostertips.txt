**Drop Kill** - On maps with a drop-ship or entry zone, fake a task before making a kill. Afterward, sabotage something (preferably lights) and run away. Take care not to run into anyone who may check for this or they will accuse you.
**Death Chamber** - On Skeld or Polus, head to Admin and use it to find a solo crewmate. Immediately lock their room and get in as fast as possible, checking if cams are on before venting. Secure the kill before sabotaging lights and venting out to fix them. This eliminates suspicion because the body won't get found until lights are fixed and no one can confirm you were in the kill room. Note that a kill room is only valid if it has both doors and a vent. A fast lock is crucial to avoid a second crewmate entering the targeted room. If this happens, you'll get caught venting in. Learn vent links before trying this strategy; it greatly improves success chance.
**Distracted By Task Kill** - When a crewmate does their task usually a large area of their screen is covered mainly to focus only on that task, thus limiting their view in their surroundings. You can kill nearby crewmates in front of crewmates who are distracted doing admin swipe card, take note this strategy, however, is very risky, as you cannot tell if a crewmate is genuinely doing their task or pretending to be to catch the killer in the act, this has high risks and high rewards after all.
**Vent Body camp** - Kill a target over a vent and call sabotages that don't lead people to your location. Hide nearby and when your kill ability's cooldown ends, hide in the vent and wait. When another person arrives, kill them and repeat the sabotage to stop Crewmates from reporting the body. This is usually a bad idea to do as the crewmates can simply press the button if they felt something odd in their surroundings, such as disappearing crewmates who never appeared once again and a very suspicious person staying in the same location.
**Skeld Light Kill** - On The Skeld map head to the Medbay at the start of the game. When your kill cooldown ends, sabotage the lights and vent into the Electrical area. Kill the first person to arrive and vent out to frame whoever enters next. This is effective because nobody else would have reasonably seen the body beforehand.
**Sabotage Final Kill** - When in a 2 v 1 or 3 v 2 situation call sabotage on a fatal emergency (such as reactor) and wait near it. Kill or double kill whoever enters. Since you can call it quicker than an emergency meeting can be called in most cases, you can't be stopped unless a body is found. This essentially guarantees a win.
**Immunity killer** - If a player proves they aren't the Impostor through an animation task (such as Medbay scan) killing them is of high priority. They become the most trustworthy player in the lobby otherwise so being caught by them guarantees your demise.
**Public enemy number 2** - If a suspicious innocent player is present in the round, go out of your way not to kill them but those who have targeted them. Always vote to tie to waste voting phases and keep pressure off yourself.
**Self-reporting** - Simply the act of reporting a body you killed. Can be used to inspire trust if you double back and 'find' it with other Crewmates or to accuse another innocent to win a round. Be wary, however - if used repeatedly its effectiveness can be mitigated. This tactic is dangerous on Polus because vital signs can show the crew that the body was reported immediately after it was killed.
**Crowd Kill** - First, gather at least 4 crewmates together to one spot. This can be done easily by sabotaging lights or comms. Then, when everyone is on top of each other, fake doing the task and then kill someone. The body will be reported within seconds. This is a pretty easy way to avoid suspicion because everyone is on top of each other. This could also get a crewmate ejected from the group if accused. However, this is a risky strategy if used multiple times in succession, as crewmates may notice that you are always present in the group.
**Cam killing** - On Skeld, if you see the camera light flashing in the MedBay or security hallway, you can vent into security, get a quick kill, and get out easily.
**Talking** - Make sure you talk during meetings. It has been said you shouldn't talk unless spoken to during meetings, but people will get very suspicious of your silence. However, talking too much may give yourself away as it may seem you are stalling for the meeting to end. Make sure to use a consistent tone of voice in meetings so your voice tone doesn't give you away either.
**Kill the Suspectors** - With common sense being noted, kill the suspectors first with the highest priority. Make sure they won't be able to pin suspicions on you at meetings. However, this strategy is very dangerous as crewmates may remember that the crewmate that suspected you is now dead.
**Play dumb** - Let's get an example: You or your teammate (if you're in a match of 2 or 3 Impostors.) has called a critical sabotage, like Reactor Meltdown or Oxygen Depletion (it's easier doing this last one in the Admin room, at The Skeld.), pretend to try to fix the sabotage, then when somebody is close enough, kill them, then go back to pretend to fix the crisis as soon as possible, but this time, actually fix it or let somebody else report the body while you pretend. They won't suspect anything and you can say that you were fixing the crisis and couldn't see anything, they'll probably believe you and vote off the Crewmate that reported the body, thinking they did a self-report. This task is best done when there are 2 Impostors.
**Betray your Impostor teammate** - If you see your teammate kill a Crewmate in front of you, report the body and tell them what you saw (it's risky if they tell everyone about you being his teammate), this strategy is best done if you see them using the Play Dumb strategy, if they're quick though, they can pull a self-report on you and blame you, you'll be voted off, implying you've been played with the same strategy you tried to use.
