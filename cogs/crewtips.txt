**Be the 1st one to complete a task early game** - Because you are the only one doing a task and no one is dead early game, it can make you 90% verified if you do a nearby short task which can be completed quickly and the taskbar would increase. This can prove very helpful in situations where you are not sure who to trust as you already have an idea of who is a crewmate based on what they had done to increase the taskbar (An example of this would be the MIRA HQ task in the launchpad area, where you have to fuel the engine, it's the fastest short task nearby which can make the taskbar go up and only some crewmates may have it, it can practically make a crewmate 100% verified or help you in finding the Impostor who is faking it).
**Watch others do visual tasks** - If you see someone at scanner (Medbay), asteroids (Weapons), shields or Skeld trash (Storage), stop and watch them do it. If they leave and no animation has played, they may be the impostor faking the task and calling an emergency meeting or making it known during discussion would be best. If an animation does play, they must be innocent and you could stick with them, and certainly vouch for them.
**Never mark someone as 100% innocent for grouping with you** - Just because they were with you for some time in the game it doesn't make them 100% innocent (unless seen doing visual tasks), as they could have very well have killed someone before you had met, it's best to take note how long the kill cooldown of an impostor is, that way you can vouch for someone based on those facts.
**Finish tasks early** - Try to finish your tasks ASAP. During the endgame when there are 3 to 4 people left, you have to all stick together and constantly run around the map to fix sabotages while trying to complete tasks.
**Get Yourself Verified** - Get other players to see you performing a medical bay scan, priming shields, emptying the trash chute in the storage area, or if applicable, shooting asteroids, as these are the only actions that can completely verify one's status as a Crewmate.
**Stay Near Verified Crewmates** - Stay with people that you trust or have seen doing tasks.
**Don't be suspicious** - If you aren't verified, don't run around chasing people, it only gets you kicked out.
**In the endgame, have a buddy** - In the final 4 situations, either all clump together or go in groups of 2. That way, if a buddy dies, you know their buddy is the Impostor. The Impostor would try to split up the group but can't because it usually means abandoning their own buddy, which is also suspicious.
**Show yourself being targeted** - If you see an Impostor use a vent and/or start chasing you and you are able to escape their initial ambush, rushing for the button isn't always best, as you have no evidence that they're an Impostor and in some cases, Crewmates may suspect you instead of throwing the accused out. Instead, make them chase you to rooms where other Crewmates may be working. Either you escape the Impostor and can then go to call a meeting or resume your tasks, or the Impostor continues to follow you and is seen chasing you by other Crewmates, gathering support in your favor to kick out the Impostor once a meeting is called. Once other Crewmates besides you realize the Impostor's identity, it only takes one of you to go and call a meeting to get the Impostor kicked out, and they can't chase all of you at once if you take different routes. This method can help to win the game if they're the only Impostor or only Impostor left.
**Don't call a meeting at the start of the game** - There are plenty of reasons this could be a good idea: you can make strategies with your teammates, you can reset the shortened Impostor kill cooldown, or you could tell people to follow you to a visual task, however calling an emergency meeting at the start of the game almost guarantees you will die. Others may become angry at the inconvenience and eject you for it.
**Use security** - While using security you are a sitting duck, but with practice, you can tell approximately where everyone should be on the map unless they vented. (especially on Skeld)
**Use admin** - Using this will enable you to know the locations of Anonymous Crewmates/Impostors dead or alive, it is implied that if a Crewmate quickly blinks out then reappears in fractions of a second in a certain area it would mean they are dead, so keep an eye out for that and start moving once this has happened. The map itself is transparent to some extent, so your vulnerability is quite low in these cases.
**Use sensors** - In MIRA HQ, using this will enable you to know the locations in which Crewmates go to in certain time periods and if you have comprehensive mind, you can know who had vented in certain locations, the sensors have a 5 second cooldown though for respective users.
**Use Vitals** - This is an option in POLUS, where you can check the status of every player (Crewmate or not). If someone is dead, it will show up and you can use the process of elimination to figure out who killed them.
